# Frequency Graphs & Collatz Conjecture

This repository contains implementations for computing and visualizing data related to the **Collatz Conjecture**, with a focus on measuring **frequency** and **count** statistics for various input ranges. The project includes **C++ programs** for generating data and **Python scripts** for plotting and analyzing results.

## What is the Collatz Conjecture?

The **Collatz Conjecture** is a mathematical problem proposed by Lothar Collatz in 1937. It states that for any positive integer `n`, the following sequence will eventually reach `1`:

1. If `n` is even → divide it by `2`:  
   `n = n / 2`
2. If `n` is odd → multiply by `3` and add `1`:  
   `n = 3n + 1`
3. Repeat the process until `n == 1`.

While no proof exists, the conjecture holds for all tested numbers, leading to interesting numerical patterns.

## Program Usage

See the indiviual READMME's inside the files for specific instructions on usage.

## Summary

This project explores the Collatz Conjecture through computational analysis and visualization. By generating and plotting frequency/count distributions, I aim to uncover hidden patterns in this intriguing mathematical sequence.
